## Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

I want to use the time while we're unable to meet in person to develop skills that might be hard to learn in a traditional classroom. So we'll focus on three [essential standards][es] (click on the link for more details about the individual standards):
* remote collaboration,
* self-directed learning, and
* assessing your work.

These turn out to be skills that are highly valued by employers and ones that you are likely to use professionally if you pursue a career in game design or a related field.

## Demonstrating Your Learning

There are _many_ options for what you could be doing to develop your game design and programming skills. Here are some suggestions:
* Keep working in JavaScript on Code.Org. Complete Unit 3 and build a game of your own design.
* Learn about Unity - install Unity and work through an online class. We were going to do [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com), but there are many options.
* Explore simulations.
* Learn to do "paper prototyping"
