## Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

I want to use the time while we're unable to meet in person to develop skills that might be hard to learn in a traditional classroom. So we'll focus on three [essential standards][es] (click on the link for more details about the individual standards):
* remote collaboration,
* self-directed learning, and
* assessing your work.

These turn out to be skills that are highly valued by employers and ones that you are likely to use professionally if you pursue a career in game design or a related field.

## Demonstrating Your Learning

There are _many_ options for what you could be doing to develop your game design and programming skills. Here are some suggestions:
* Keep working in JavaScript on Code.Org. Complete Unit 3 and build a game of your own design.
* Learn about Unity - install Unity and work through an online class. We were going to do [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com), but there are many options.
* Explore simulations.
* Learn to do "paper prototyping" 

## Asynchronous Collaboration

You may find it helpful to get notifications from Canvas. To do this you will need to add a working e-mail adderess (the SKSD Google accounts we use for authentication don't have valid e-mail associated with them) or number for SMS (text) messages. To do this:
1. Sign in to Canvas.
1. Click on the [**Account**](https://canvas.instructure.com/profile) button on the left-hand sidebar.
1. Select [**Settings**](https://canvas.instructure.com/profile/settings).
1. Under **Ways to Contact**, you'll find **Email Addresses** and **Other Contacts**. Below those either the **+ Email Address** or the **+ Contact Method** links will take you to a dialog that will let you add an e-mail adderess and/or a cell number for notifications.
1. If you find that you'd like to adjust the type or frequency of notifications that you get you can do that under the [**Notifications**](https://canvas.instructure.com/profile/communication) item in your account.
